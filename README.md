# MultiSig Wallet Implementation

A complete implementation of a multi-signature wallet system using the Minimal Proxy Pattern (EIP-1167) with advanced features including EIP-712 signature support and comprehensive proposal management.

## Why Minimal Proxy Pattern?

This wallet service is ideally suited for a factory-based architecture that generates multiple proxy instances executing the same implementation logic. When designing such a system, two primary patterns emerge:

1. **Beacon Proxy Pattern**: Where the factory acts as a beacon, preserving upgradeability for all wallet instances
2. **Minimal Proxy Pattern**: A more lightweight approach that eliminates upgradeability in favor of immutability

Given the requirements of this implementation, the **Minimal Proxy Pattern** was chosen for several key reasons:

**üéØ Inherent Flexibility Reduces Upgrade Necessity**
The wallet's minimalist design already provides tremendous flexibility through its ability to "execute an arbitrary method on an arbitrary contract." This architectural flexibility significantly diminishes the need for future upgrades to the core logic.

**üîí User Security Preferences**
From a user perspective, once the wallet logic has undergone thorough security audits, the requirement for code immutability typically outweighs the desire for new feature additions through upgrades. Users generally prefer the certainty that their wallet's behavior cannot be changed post-deployment.

**‚ö° Gas Efficiency**
The minimal proxy pattern offers superior gas efficiency for deployment, with each wallet instance requiring only ~55 bytes compared to much larger beacon proxy implementations.

**üèóÔ∏è Real-World Validation**
This design choice aligns with industry standards - **Gnosis Safe**, one of the most widely adopted multi-signature wallet systems, employs the same minimal proxy architecture, validating this approach's effectiveness in production environments.

By eliminating upgradeability, I prioritize security, transparency, and user trust while maintaining the system's core flexibility through its arbitrary contract execution capabilities.

## Features

- **Minimal Proxy Pattern**: Gas-efficient deployment using EIP-1167
- **k-of-n Multi-signature**: Configurable threshold voting system
- **EIP-712 Signatures**: Support for off-chain signature verification
- **EIP-1271 Support**: Contract-based signer compatibility
- **Proposal System**: Comprehensive proposal lifecycle management
- **Multicall Execution**: Execute multiple transactions atomically
- **Signer Management**: Add/remove signers through governance
- **Replay Protection**: Built-in nonce system prevents signature replay attacks

## Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **MultiSigWallet.sol** - Main implementation contract
2. **MultiSigWalletFactory.sol** - Factory for deploying wallet instances
3. **SignatureHelper.sol** - Not part of this take-home assignemnt, but demonstrates utility for offchain EIP-712 signature generation

### Contract Structure

```
MultiSigWalletFactory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates minimal proxies pointing to MultiSigWallet implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tracks all deployed wallets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Provides deterministic deployment options

MultiSigWallet (Implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Proposal management (create, vote, execute, cancel)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Signer management (add/remove through governance)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EIP-712 signature verification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multicall execution

```

## Usage

### 1. Deploy Factory

```solidity
MultiSigWalletFactory factory = new MultiSigWalletFactory();
```

### 2. Create Wallet Instance

```solidity
address[] memory signers = [signer1, signer2, signer3];
address wallet = factory.createWallet(signers);
```

### 3. Create Proposal

```solidity
address[] memory targets = [targetContract];
uint256[] memory values = [0]; // ETH to send
bytes[] memory calldatas = [abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()")];
uint256 expiration = block.timestamp + 7 days;

uint256 proposalId = MultiSigWallet(wallet).propose(
    targets,
    values,
    calldatas,
    expiration
);
```

### 4. Vote on Proposal

**Direct voting:**
```solidity
MultiSigWallet(wallet).vote(proposalId);
```

**Off-chain signature voting:**
```solidity
// Generate signature off-chain using EIP-712
bytes memory signature = generateEIP712Signature(proposalId, true, voterPrivateKey);

// Submit vote with signature
MultiSigWallet(wallet).voteOnBehalfOf(proposalId, voter, true, signature);
```

### 5. Execute Proposal

```solidity
MultiSigWallet(wallet).execute(proposalId);
```

## Key Functions

### Proposal Management

- `propose()` - Create new proposal (proposer automatically votes)
- `vote()` - Vote on proposal
- `cancelVote()` - Remove vote from proposal
- `execute()` - Execute approved proposal
- `cancelProposal()` - Cancel proposal (proposer or governance only)

### Signature-based Voting

- `voteOnBehalfOf()` - Vote using EIP-712/EIP-1271 signature
- `cancelVoteOnBehalfOf()` - Cancel vote using signature

### Signer Management

- `addSigner()` - Add new signer (governance only)
- `removeSigner()` - Remove existing signer (governance only)

### View Functions

- `getSigners()` - Get all current signers
- `getProposal()` - Get proposal details
- `hasVoted()` - Check if address voted on proposal
- `getDomainSeparator()` - Get EIP-712 domain separator

## Security Features

### Replay Protection
- Each signer has an individual nonce counter
- Nonces prevent signature replay across transactions
- Domain separator prevents cross-contract replay

### Governance Protection
- Only contract itself can modify signers
- Requires majority approval for signer changes
- Prevents unauthorized access to critical functions

### Execution Safety
- All-or-nothing execution (atomic multicall)
- Validates signer status before execution
- Removes votes from de-authorized signers

## EIP-712 Signature Structure

```solidity
struct Vote {
    uint256 proposalId;
    bool support;
    uint256 nonce;
}
```

**Domain:**
- name: "MultiSigWallet"
- version: "1"
- chainId: Current chain ID
- verifyingContract: Wallet address

## Example Usage Scenarios

### 1. Treasury Management
```solidity
// Transfer 100 ETH to recipient
address[] memory targets = [recipient];
uint256[] memory values = [100 ether];
bytes[] memory calldatas = [""];
```

### 2. Contract Interaction
```solidity
// Call external contract function
address[] memory targets = [targetContract];
uint256[] memory values = [0];
bytes[] memory calldatas = [abi.encodeWithSignature("mint(address,uint256)", recipient, amount)];
```

### 3. Signer Management
```solidity
// Add new signer
address[] memory targets = [address(wallet)];
uint256[] memory values = [0];
bytes[] memory calldatas = [abi.encodeWithSignature("addSigner(address)", newSigner)];
```
